# ShanghaiRichBubble

In 2022, Shanghai officially had 23 million inhabitants, spanning 52 km from east to west. Yet, expats and wealthy Shanghainese families live within a 1 km radius bubble.

I always assumed we were all alike inside this mini bubble. However, even in what Americans describe as a communist country, locals rank themselves based on where they live, which serves as a social clue of wealth—even within the bubble! 

To explore this further, I decided to use the Python package **Folium** to visualize my neighborhood.

Honestly, I now walk with a better understanding of the cars parked in front of each compound—all in just three lines of code!
