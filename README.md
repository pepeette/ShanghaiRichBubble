# ShanghaiRichBubble
In 2022, Shanghai officially had 23 millions inhabitants. From east to west, the city expands up to 52km. 
Yet... expats and rich Shanghaiese families live in a 1km radius bubble. 

I always assumed that we were all alike inside this mini bubble.

But no, even in what American people describe as a communist country,
Locals do rank themselves...
Depending on where you live., as a social clue of wealth.. 
even inside the Bubble ;-)

So I decided to use python package folium 
To visualize my neighbourhood  

Honestly, I now walk with a better understanding of the cars parked in front of each compound...
in 3 lines of code.
