# ShanghaiRichBubble
In 2022, Shanghai officially had 23 millions inhabitants. From east to west, the city expands up to 52km. 
Yet... expats and rich Shanghaiese families live in a 1km radius bubble. 

I always assumed that we were all alike inside this mini bubble.

But no, even what American describe as a communist country,
Locals rank themselves...
Depending on where you live... even inside the Bubble ;-)

So I decided to use python package folium 
To visualize my beighbourhood analysis 

Honestly, I now walk with a better understanding of the cars parked in front of each compound...
